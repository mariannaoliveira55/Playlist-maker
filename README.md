# Playlist-maker
This project consists of studying a dataset of audio tracks available on the Spotify streaming platform. The study includes data wrangling for cleaning the data, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to visualize relationships between features, and the application of unsupervised learning algorithms. The latter aims to identify patterns and similarities among different songs and group them, with the goal of enabling the creation of playlists with similar tracks based on a genre-focused analysis.
